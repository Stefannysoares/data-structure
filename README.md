# data-structure
# Welcome 
Hello guy, it's good to see you here! Welcome to my data structure repository.

# What to find here ? 
Here in this repository you will find all **activities and exercises** completed while studying data structure in my college. 

# How the codes are organized
You will find three packages: Controller , Main and View.

**Controller** - In this package are the void classes, where the data will be manipulated.

**View** - In the View package you will find specific void classes for each activity list, which will allow you to navigate between the exercises in that list and input data for the classes present in the controller package can to manipulate.

**Main** - It's where you'll find the main class named Menu, where if you make a copy of this repository and run the code in any java IDE, you'll be able to navigate through all the classes present in all packages.
